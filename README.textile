h1. sha1-service

This service allows you to post a url that points to a file.  The service will then download that file, run it through sha1sum and return the checksum.

Example:

This would generate sha1 checksum for the content of the "original" datastream in a Fedora object with pid chagneme:20

http://localhost:3000/sha1?url=http://localhost:8983/fedora/objects/changeme:20/datastreams/original/content

h2. Known Issues

* assumes UNIX/Linux with sha1sum installed
